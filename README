Hyper Text Silkworm
===================
Hyper Text Silkworm is a PHP library to aid in the creation of HTML documents in PHP. Hyper Text Silkworm is an abstraction layer from HTML which allows you to focus on PHP when you're programming in PHP and worry about HTML presentation later.

Hyper Text Silkworm generates nicely carriaged returned and indented HTML from your PHP files. The library is dynamic and can be used in a modular fashion allowing you to break up the document creation process into logical chunks throughout your program.

History
-------
Hyper Text Silkworm was built from the ground up, but was inspired by naomik's htmlgen.
