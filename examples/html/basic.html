				<tr>
					<td>Example 1 shows you that you can write out everything directly as a set of tags if you like. If you want to make a standard template that you plug every thing into, this is one method that you might want to employ.</td>
					<td>Example 2 shows that you can break everything up into more manageable parts, that you can then toss into Silkworm for some quick formatting and parsing before you display it. This allows you to divide web page creation into parts that can be managed by classes that you define yourself. This also introduces the autoTable() function which accepts a multidimensional array and turns it into an HTML table.</td>
					<td>Example 3 is available to show that this library is fairly Dynamic and the only thing holding you back is creativity.</td>
